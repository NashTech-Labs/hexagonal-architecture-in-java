# Hexagonal Architecture in Java

- Hexagonal architecture is a model of designing software applications around domain logic to isolate it from external factors.
- The domain logic is specified in a business core, which is the inside part, the rest being outside parts. 
- Access to domain logic from the outside is available through ports and adapters.
